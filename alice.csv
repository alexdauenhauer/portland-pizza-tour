The salad was lacking in variety of flavors, but the produce was high quality and just not chopped very well. But it was different. I didn't give a very high creativity mark because there was nothing that stuck out to me.",7.75

I also enjoyed the nuts. The pizza was disappointing. because the pineapples made it to sweet. it made the sauce taste like barbecue sauce which was just not my flavor. it might be good for someone else. there were no other items on the menu that looked very exciting to me.,6.875
