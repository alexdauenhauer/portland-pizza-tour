Alex,Handsome Pizza,marinara,8,7,8,8.5,6,6,10,7,5.00,5.00,7.05,"not the best for vegan options. very tangy, but not in a bad way. tangy in the crust and the sauce. really positive message with living wage fee and I support their mission to provide a living wage to their workers. would eat here again, but might try different toppings"
Alice,,sergio olmos,7,7,8,n/a,8,8,9,7,5.00,3.00,6.89,no comment I guess
Alex,Mississippi pizza,amaizeing,8,8,7,6,9,9,n/a,9,8,8,8,"great vegan options. caramelized onion sauce was a pretty major letdown. I was quite excited, but it was basically non-existent. slicing sucked. long and skinny aslices no one wants that. would definitely go back want to try all the vegan options"
Alice,,spicoli,7,8,8,6,8,7,n/a,9,9,7,7.666666667,the salad was the highlight of this meal. it had fresh ingredients including a Chev type goat cheese and incredible dressing. I also enjoyed the nuts. The pizza was disappointing. because the pineapples made it to sweet. it made the sauce taste like barbecue sauce which was just not my flavor. it might be good for someone else. there were no other items on the menu that looked very exciting to me.
Alex,Gracie's Apizza,vegan,9,9,9,9,9,9,n/a,9,6,n/a,8.625,"a lot of things are right about this pizza. the toppings are amazing, preserved eggplant, onions, great sauce. the crust was perfect it can't get better, but it can be equally good and different. the only thing that could have made it better is a little heat. some hot oil would have done the trick"
Alice,,ricotta,9,8,8,9,9,8,n/a,8,7,8,8.222222222,"Best yet - availability was marked down lower than I would have given it because the pizza I wanted online was actually not available and out of date. The salad was lacking in variety of flavors, but the produce was high quality and just not chopped very well. But it was different. I didn't give a very high creativity mark because there was nothing that stuck out to me."
Alex,Ranch Pizza,Veggie (vegan),9,7,8,9,8,6,,9,n/a,5,7.625,"really good. I think the pan style crust is not my thing, but this was still very good"
Alice,,special / pepperoni,9,9,10,8,8,8,n/a,9,n/a,9,8.75,The pan style crust blew me away. reminded me a little bit of the deep dish I had in Chicago.
Alex,Tastebud,vegan,8,8,10,8,6,10,9,5,10,,8.222222222,"on a different night would probably have been number 1 so far. they forgot my spicy cashew cream which was a big minus for them because that would have been a key ingredient. the rest of the toppings were good, but had too much salsa flavor. their crust was perfect as usual"
Alice,,pesto,9,7,8,9,8,9,9,8,9,9,8.5,"I normally really enjoy this place, but today it was only meh. I ordered the pesto which came with pesto sauce, cherry tomatoes, and several cheeses... ultimately it tasted like an upscale cheese pizza."

Alice,,chanterelle,10,9,9,9,9,10,n/a,8,7,,8.875,"small selection, however they did have everything I wanted. I was questioning whether or not it was going to be good with the roasted onions - yet it was incredible."
Alex,Pizza Jerk,vegan sausage,8,7,6,8,6,5,8,8,n/a,5,6.777777778,"they gave me a free beer while I waited for my pizza so that was a great message. too much vegan cheese which made the crust soggy, otherwise decent flavor"
Alice,,clam,9,7,8,9,8,7,n/a,9,n/a,,8.142857143,first time I've had clam pizza. it was surprisingly delicious.
Alex,Red Sauce Pizza,it's me nummy,10,8,9,9,10,8,9,9,n/a,n/a,9,"this pizza really hit the spot. a classic combo of pineapple, vegan pepperoni, and jalapeno. basically what I would put on a pizza if I was making it from scratch. nailed it in basically every category"
Alice,,mushrooms and cheese,7,8,7,8,7,6,9,8,n/a,n/a,7.5,very forgettable

Alice,,"Buffalo Moz w/pepperoni, garlic and wild mushrooms",10,10,8,10,10,9,9,10,n/a,n/a,9.5,The inner crust is the shining star. I have never had a piece of pizza that was this then yet strong and mighty. it is absolutely delicious. The quality of ingredients is top shelf.
