Pizzeria Otto,8.857142857142858,10.0,10.0,8.0,10.0,10.0,9.0,9.0,10.0,,,The inner crust is the shining star. I have never had a piece of pizza that was this then yet strong and mighty. it is absolutely delicious. The quality of ingredients is top shelf.
Dove Vivi,8.666666666666666,10.0,9.0,10.0,8.0,10.0,9.0,,10.0,,,very very interesting. only complaint is that it was a different tye of crust

Tastebud,8.0,9.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,"I normally really enjoy this place, but today it was only meh. I ordered the pesto which came with pesto sauce, cherry tomatoes, and several cheeses... ultimately it tasted like an upscale cheese pizza."

Gracie's Apizza,7.75,9.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,8.0,,8.0,7.0,8.0,"Best yet - availability was marked down lower than I would have given it because the pizza I wanted online was actually not available and out of date. The salad was lacking in variety of flavors, but the produce was high quality and just not chopped very well. But it was different. I didn't give a very high creativity mark because there was nothing that stuck out to me."

Mississippi pizza,6.875,7.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,8.0,7.0,,9.0,9.0,7.0,the salad was the highlight of this meal. it had fresh ingredients including a Chev type goat cheese and incredible dressing. I also enjoyed the nuts. The pizza was disappointing. because the pineapples made it to sweet. it made the sauce taste like barbecue sauce which was just not my flavor. it might be good for someone else. there were no other items on the menu that looked very exciting to me.
